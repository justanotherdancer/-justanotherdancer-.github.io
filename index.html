59 <p><strong>Mostly 1st choices:</strong>&nbsp;Mostly As: &ldquo;Dash and Crash&rdquo; Stress Type</p> 
60 
 
61 <p>You&rsquo;re a high achiever fueled by stress. It keeps you focused and running, but once the stress is reduced or eliminated, you crash. You likely multitask like crazy during the week, but on the weekends, find yourself passed out on the couch.&nbsp;</p> 
62 
 
63 <p><strong>Mostly 2nd choices: </strong>Mostly B's: &ldquo;Constant Overdrive&rdquo; Stress Type</p> 
64 
 
65 <p>You have a difficult time relaxing because even though you&rsquo;re very logical, you&rsquo;re always in your head. Your fight-or-flight response is easily triggered and doesn&rsquo;t shut off. It&rsquo;s common for people with this stress type to be habitually anxious and have trouble falling asleep. You often operate with blinders on, powering through tough times &ndash; you have a hard time connecting to and feeling your emotions.</p> 
66 
 
67 <p><strong>Mostly 3rd choices:&nbsp;</strong>Mostly Cs: &ldquo;Zero to 60&rdquo; Stress Type</p> 
68 
 
69 <p>You aren&rsquo;t one for multitasking and are likely to describe yourself as &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; or &ldquo;drained.&rdquo; From the outside you seem calm and collected but the reality is you&rsquo;re paralyzed by even a little bit of stress. You become fearful and anxious, struggling to find a way to move forward.</p>
